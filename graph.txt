A graph can have cycles or may not having cycles - Cyclic Graph and Acyclic Graph
A graph edge may have weights or not - Weighted and unweighted graph
A graph's edge may be directed or not - Directed and undirected graph

A component is sub graph that is not connected with other part of the graph (Only in undirected graphs)

cyclic or acyclic, Undirected and unweighted graph - cycle detection : BFS/DFS
cyclic or acyclic, Undirected and unweighted graph - Bipartite Graph : BFS/DFS
